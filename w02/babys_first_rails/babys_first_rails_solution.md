Answer the following questions as best you can:

1. What is a strength of Rails (or something you like about Rails)?
    very organize, quick to create and easy to make changes
2. What is a "controller"? How is it different from a "route"?
    controller is a file where all of your methods go to render, route is where you assign a path for your website and call a method in a controller
3. Why could it be useful to render json over html?
    json shows all of the data of the website
4. List at least one question you have about Rails.
    I can't think of a question right now, the only problem I had was running into "render json: { variable: }" I wasted a lot of time figuring out how to call a variable, but I understand it now.
