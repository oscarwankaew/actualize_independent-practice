### If we made an API for events happening in San Francisco... 
1. What would be the HTTP verb and url combination that would retrieve a list of all events?

- HTTP verb: GET
- URL: GET "/events/index"

2. What would be the HTTP verb and url combination that would retrieve the event with id of 4?

- HTTP verb: GET
-URL: GET "/events/:id"

3. If you saw the HTTP verb and url combination "POST /events", using REST principles what action would it be performing?

- POST verb is for creating new event to the data base.

4. What is the `:id` portion of the route doing? Why do we use id? 

- It is a segment parameter calling specific id of certain model.
